 # MatBuilder


 This folder contains both the source code of MatBuilder and profiles used in the paper (tested on linux and MacOS).


## Building MatBuilder

 To build the code, you would need an install of the CPLEX Optimization Studio (free for academics,). Once CPLEX as been installed:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

Then you can run the solver using:

```
./MatBuilder -i profiles/generic_net.txt -o output-matrices.dat
```

(`-h` to get the list of options).
